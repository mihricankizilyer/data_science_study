# **One Sample T Test and One Sample Proportion Test**
## One Sample T Test
It is a parametric test used to test whether there is a statistically significant difference between the population mean and a hypothetical value.

- H0: m=50   ve  H1: m!=50 
- H0: m<=50  ve  H1: m>50 
- H0: m>=50  ve  H1: m<50

- t = (x - m) / (s / n^1/2)
- z = (x - m) / ( q / n^1/2)

1. If the population standard deviation is known, the z statistic is used.
2. If the population standard deviation is unknown and n> 30, the z statistic is used.
3. Population standard deviation is unknown and if n <30 t statistics are used.

Examples:

- Used when calculating the average age of a district.
- Used to calculate the time people spend on the website.
