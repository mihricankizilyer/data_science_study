## **Hypotheses and Types**

- H0: m=50   ve  H1: m!=50 

- H0: m<=50  ve  H1: m>50 

- H0: m>=50  ve  H1: m<50

## **P-value**
- p < 0.05

If the p-value value is less than 0.05, the corresponding H0 hypothesis is rejected.

## **Hypothesis Testing Steps**

1. Establishing hypotheses and determining their directions
2. Determining the level of significance and table value (alpha)
3. Determination of test statistics and calculation of test statistics
4. Comparison of the calculated test statistics with the table values corresponding to alpha
