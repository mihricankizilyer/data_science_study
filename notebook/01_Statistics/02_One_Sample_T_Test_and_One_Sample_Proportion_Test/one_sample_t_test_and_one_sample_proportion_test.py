## Business Practice: Product Purchase Step Optimization

Problem : After adding a product to the cart, there are 5 steps on the payment screen and one of these steps is queried.
Detail:
- Each step is 20 seconds. It has a goal to be. Step 4 is being questioned.
- 100 samples are taken to test this situation.
- Sample standard deviation is 5 seconds. The sample average is 19 seconds.

Step1 : Establishing hypotheses and determining their directions
- H0: m = 20
> H0 hypothesis means the unknown population parameter m, that is, the average time people spent in step 4 is 20.
- H1: m! = 20
> Average with unknown population, ie the time that all people spent in step 4 is 20 seconds different.

Step2 : Determining the significance level and table value
a = 0.05
a / 2 = 0.025
Ztable table probability value: 0.5-0.025 = 0.475
Ztable critical value = - / + 1.96

Step3 : Determination of test statistics and calculation of test statistics
z = (x - m) / (q - n ^ 1/2)
zaccount = (19-20) / (5/100 ^ 1/2) = -2
n = 100, std = 5, sample mean = 19 sec

Step4 : Ztablo and Zhaccount comparison H0 Red if Zh> Zt or -Zh <-Zt
H0 is rejected because Ztable = -2 <Ztable = 1.96.

Step5:
Comment: The H0 hypothesis claiming that the time spent in step 4 was 20 seconds was rejected. Accordingly, users spend time different than 20 seconds in step 4 with a statistical reliability of 95 percent.

## Testing the Time Spent on the Website
Problem : Is the average time spent on our website really 170 seconds?

Detail:
Average passed on the website obtained from the software. there are periods.
When these data are examined, a manager or employee has thoughts about the absence of these values and they want to test this situation.
H0: m = 170
H1: m! = 170

We can make evaluations by looking at the p-value value.

## Conversion Rate Test
Problem:An advertisement was placed on a medium with a software and it was stated that a conversion rate of 0.125 was achieved by the software related to this advertisement. But this situation is wanted to be controlled. Because this is a high rate and does not match when the incomes are examined.
